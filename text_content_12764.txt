Considering improvements to your outdoor facilities?
({?url?}https://www.trulawn.co.uk{?/url?})
Lots of schools have chosen to make outdoor improvements to upgrade their games and sports facilities.

Soft, durable, all-weather artificial grass play areas are ideal for school environments because it doesn’t wear thin and stays green throughout the year.

With coloured grass and sport grass options, your outdoor areas can be completely transformed for pupils and the wider community.

Common responses might be; communal areas, around play equipment, a playing field or running track, a MUGA

What is the rough size?
An approximate width (m) x length (m) of the area will help us to give you a ballpark. For projects over a certain size we'd jump straight to booking a survey.
